# Ecology-R-Labs
A series of labs introducing students to coding in R and then using datasets to illustrate ecological concepts. Also, a module using R to generate a species distribution model. 

1_IntroBioinformaticsTools.docx - This file and the associated RMD helps student get R and R Studio on their computers and functioning. While there are some preliminary instructions for how to get R Studio on a Chromebook, I have yet to get this to work. I have been able to get base R to work, but not R Studio. 

2_IntroR.docx - This and the associated RMD is a crashcourse in navigating the R Studio interface and enter and execute code in R. Students will learn how to read data and build some basic plots. 

3_CommunityAssembly.docx - This and the associated RMD uses a real data set and R plots to illustrate a number of ecological concepts. 

4_DistributionModeling.docx - This and the associated RMD is a lab module that walks students through the basics of constructing a species distribution model in R Studio. 

Data.zip - These are the datafiles necessary for these labs. Citations for the data sets are included.
